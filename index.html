            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ <br>I'm George Lynch, and let me tell you a bit about my journey.

                I started out in the world of retail management, navigating the hustle and bustle of customer service and operations. But then, something unexpected happened â€“ the tech bug bit me hard! With little computer knowledge at first, I took the plunge into the vast world of programming, and boy, what a ride it's been.
                
                Now, I proudly call myself a full-stack programmer, specializing in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. From crafting beautiful web pages to coding complex functionalities, I love every aspect of bringing ideas to life in the digital realm.
                
                One thing you should know about me is that I'm not just about solo coding sessions. I thrive in team environments, bouncing ideas off each other, collaborating, and collectively creating something awesome.
                
                I'm not one to shy away from challenges â€“ in fact, I embrace them wholeheartedly. A fast learner by nature, I believe in the power of continuous growth and lifelong learning. Every day is an opportunity to expand my skill set and dive deeper into the ever-evolving world of technology.
                
                Currently, I'm flexing my skills as a Quality Assurance Analyst, where testing software is certainly a blast. But deep down, my heart yearns to do more than just test â€“ I want to build, innovate, and make a tangible impact through coding.
                
                So, here I am, fueled by passion, driven by curiosity, and ready to embark on the next chapter of my journey â€“ one line of code at a time.

In addition to my role as a Quality Assurance Analyst at Paycom, I am proud to have embarked on a transformative journey of growth and learning through a year-long mentorship at Hangar2Apps, under the guidance of Bryan Rigsby, a seasoned Senior Developer in the industry.

During my mentorship at Hangar2Apps, I immersed myself in a rich learning environment, acquiring a comprehensive skill set that spans the entire spectrum of web development.

The mentorship experience at Hangar2Apps represents a significant milestone in my professional journey, as it provided me with the tools and knowledge necessary to transition from a newcomer in the tech industry to a proficient web developer. I am immensely proud of the progress I have made, from initially having little experience to now possessing the ability to code dynamic and responsive websites with confidence and proficiency.

The mentorship not only equipped me with technical skills but also instilled in me a mindset of continuous learning and growth. Bryan's mentorship was invaluable in shaping my approach to problem-solving, fostering collaboration, and instilling a passion for innovation that drives me to excel in every endeavor.

I am deeply grateful for the opportunity to learn from Bryan and the entire team at Hangar2Apps. Their guidance, support, and expertise have been instrumental in my professional development, and I am committed to leveraging the knowledge and skills gained during my mentorship to drive meaningful impact and deliver exceptional results in my career.

In summary, my mentorship at Hangar2Apps has been a transformative experience, propelling me from a novice to a proficient web developer equipped with the skills and confidence to tackle any challenge.

            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>From 2004 to 2007, I embarked on an enriching journey at the University of Central Oklahoma, nestled in the vibrant city of Edmond, Oklahoma. During this time, I devoted myself to the pursuit of knowledge and earned my Bachelor of Science degree in Kinesiology.

My educational journey at the University of Central Oklahoma laid a strong foundation for my future endeavors. I discovered a profound passion for training athletes, fueled by a desire to unlock their full potential and enhance their performance on the field. However, as life unfolded and responsibilities grew with a burgeoning family, I found myself at a crossroads.

Driven by an insatiable curiosity and a hunger for new challenges, I ventured into the realm of technology. I recognized the boundless opportunities it presented and embarked on a transformative journey to reinvent myself in this dynamic field. To equip myself with the requisite skills and knowledge, I pursued several certifications tailored to the burgeoning tech industry landscape.

This transition from the realm of sports and human performance to the realm of technology was not merely a career pivot; it was a profound evolution of my skills and aspirations. In essence, I transitioned from programming humans to programming machines, leveraging my innate passion for optimization and improvement in a new domain.

As a lifelong learner, I approach each day with a sense of curiosity and a commitment to continuous growth. The tech industry is ever-evolving, presenting new challenges and opportunities with each passing moment. I embrace this fluidity and remain steadfast in my pursuit of excellence, knowing that my educational journey is far from over.

My educational experience serves as a testament to my adaptability, resilience, and unwavering determination to chart my own path in the tech industry. With each milestone achieved and each skill acquired, I am poised to navigate the ever-changing landscape of technology with confidence and conviction.

In conclusion, my educational journey from Kinesiology to the tech industry reflects not only a professional transition but a personal evolutionâ€”a testament to my relentless pursuit of knowledge and my unwavering commitment to self-improvement. As I continue to traverse the realms of technology, I am fueled by a sense of purpose and a boundless enthusiasm for the limitless possibilities that lie ahead.
